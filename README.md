"# image_categorizer_Torob" 

The dataset for this project belongs to the <a href="https://torob.com/" target="_blank">Torob</a> website, containing a portion of the real data from this website. Torob is a shopping search engine that aggregates information about each product from various online stores and displays it on a unified page. Therefore, users will be able to easily find their desired product and compare it among different sellers. One of the most critical technical requirements for such a platform is automatic product information extraction, as manual refinement of this volume of data would be very time-consuming and costly. Perhaps the most crucial information for such a platform is product categorization, as it plays a significant role in its searchability. Hence, in this project, we are designing a deep learning model that can classify a product based on its image.

Please note that the dataset size is approximately 270 megabytes.
